⚡ **AutoML Python Project** ⚡

This repository contains a Python script for automating the process of building and training machine learning models 🤖. The goal is to streamline the workflow of model selection, training, and evaluation to achieve optimal results with minimal manual intervention.

✨ **Features**
- 🚀 **Automated Model Selection**: Automatically selects from a variety of machine learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting).
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, scaling, and encoding of categorical variables.
- 🎯 **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilizes grid search and cross-validation to find the best model configurations.
- 📊 **Model Evaluation**: Provides accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and other performance metrics.
- 💾 **Model Export**: Trained models can be saved for later use in production environments.

📦 **Dependencies**
Make sure you have the following libraries installed before running the script:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install the dependencies using pip 📥:

pip install -r requirements.txt

 📊**Input Data Format**
The script expects the input dataset to be in a CSV format with the following structure:

- Features: All independent variables should be in separate columns.
- Target Variable: The dependent variable (the output to be predicted) should be in a single column.

Make sure to adjust the column names in the script to match your dataset's structure.

 ⚙️**Customization**
You can customize the algorithms, evaluation metrics, and other parameters by editing the relevant sections in the script 🛠️. Refer to the documentation for each of the algorithms in `scikit-learn` for additional options.

🏆 **Results**
Upon completion, the script outputs the following:

- Best-performing model based on cross-validation results 🏅.
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score 📈.
- A plot of feature importance (for tree-based algorithms) 🌳.
- A saved model file for future predictions 💽.
